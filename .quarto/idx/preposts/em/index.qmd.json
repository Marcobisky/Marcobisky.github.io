If you keep an eye on it, you could discover the following phenomena yourself:\n\n1. The force between two charges is proportional to their charge, and inversely proportional to their distance, squared.\n\n2. Two parallel wires attract or repel each other when current is applied.\n\n3. test\n\n4. test\n\nThese four observations leads to the four equations by Maxwell.\n\n## Integral Form of Maxwell's First Equation\n\n### Inverse Square Law\n\nAccording to observation 1, we could write[^letter]:\n$$\nF \\propto \\frac{Qq}{r^2},\n$$\nor in an equation:\n$$\n\\boxed{\nF = k \\frac{Qq}{r^2},\n}\n$$\n\n[^letter]: Non-bold-face letters ($F$) are scalars, bold-face letters ($\\mathbf{F}$) are vectors.\n\nwhere $k$ is a constant, $Q$ and $q$ are the amount of ***charge***[^chargedef] on two small objects, $r$ is their distance.\n\n[^chargedef]: The unit of charge (Coulomb) is defined in the following way (The reason *Ampere* are defined first is because *Ampere* happens to be one of the *base unit* of [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#:~:text=The%20SI%20comprises%20a%20coherent,candela%20(cd%2C%20luminous%20intensity))):\n- **Current: Ampere** (I: A): First we define Ampere (surprise!) to be the intensity of current on two ideal wires that are 1 metre apart and produces a force of $2 \\times 10^{-7}$ N between them (1N is defined to be the force that makes an object of mass 1kg moves at the acceleration of $1\\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$)\n- **Charge: Coulomb** (Q: C): Then we define Coulomb to be the amount of charge the that passes through a point with a current of 1A over 1 second.\n\n### Conservative Property\n\nLet's consider the work done when we fix $Q$ and gradually move $q$ in a certain path. Since the force from $Q$ to $q$ is always radially from $Q$, it turns out that the work done only depends on the *initial* and *final* position of $q$ regardless of the moving process in between! We say a force like this ***Conservative***[^conservative]. We would like to think that there is a number $U$ attached at every spatial point around $Q$ such that the the work done from point $A$ and $B$ is just that $U(A)-U(B)$[^ubua], i.e.,\n$$\nW_{AB} =: U(A) - U(B).\n$$\n\n[^conservative]: \nIt's worth noting that *conservativity* has nothing to do with the inverse square property.

Just to be intimidating, \n    $$\n    \\Phi_R = \\oiint_R k \\frac{q}{r^2} dA = k \\frac{q}{r^2} \\cdot 4 \\pi r^2 = 4 \\pi k q \\propto q.\n    $$\n\n    We commonly let \n    $$\n    \\boxed{\n        k = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\n    }\n    $${#eq-flux}\n    to simpify[^kreason] @eq-flux to be\n    $$\n    \\Phi_R = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}.\n    $$\n\n[^kreason]: We introduce the symbol $\\epsilon_0$ by the motivation to eliminate the \"$4 \\pi$\" @eq-flux.

Now we claim that \n    $$\n    \\Phi_R = \\Phi_S,\n    $$\n    where $S$ is an arbitrary closed surface outside $R$.\n    \n    Again we use the *inverse square property*, the flux through $\\mathrm{d}R$ should be same as the flux through the blue circle in @fig-pointcharge. Plus, the flux through the blue circle is exactly the same as the flux through $\\mathrm{d}S$ as shown in @fig-fluxcomp (since their \"perpendicular\" surface area are the same)\n\n3. We then use *superposition property* of fields to obtain the equation of multiple charges enclosed.\n\n    Suppose there are $N=3$ point charges inside $S$ as shown in @fig-super, the total flux is\n\n    $$\n    \\Phi \n    = \\oiint_S \\mathbf{E} \\cdot  \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{A} \n    = \\sum_{i = 1}^3 \\left(\\oiint_S \\mathbf{E}_i \\cdot  \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{A}\\right)\n    = \\sum_{i = 1}^3 \\frac{q_i}{\\epsilon_0}\n    = \\frac{Q_{\\text{in}}}{\\epsilon_0}.\n    $${#eq-n3}\n\n    Of course @eq-n3 can be generalized when $N$ is arbitrary.

Therefore, $Q_{\\text{in}}$ on the RHS[^rhs] of @eq-maxwellintegralform could be write as an integral:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{\\text{in}}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\iiint_V \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\mathrm{d}V,\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the region enclosed by $S$, $\\rho$ is the **density**[^delta] of charges at some place inside $S$.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Real world charges are not point charge](image.png)\n:::\n\n[^rhs]: Right hand side.\n\n[^delta]: In the case of point charges, this density if *infinite*. Mathematicians use so-called [$\\delta$-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) to describe the behaviour of this kind of \"degenerated\" density. It is not a function, just a symbol following some rules that deals with the Mathematical OCD that forces the form of a certain integral unchanged when some mass is concentrated on a small point.\n\n\nWhat about the LHS of @eq-maxwellintegralform?

The non-trivial part is inverse square. This property ensures that we can extend the sphere to an arbitrary surface in @fig-pointcharge. What is the nature of inverse square? \n\nWell, we live in 3-dimensional space. Everything that spreads should somehow decay at the rate of $1/r^2$, like light, gravity, sound, etc. Otherwise it will against the conservation of energy. In general, if we live in a $N$-dim world, fields should naturally decay at the rate of $1/r^{N-1}$. In other words, everything in $N$-dim world should decay at the rate of \"area\" decay.

Therefore, $Q_{\\text{in}}$ on the RHS[^rhs] of @eq-maxwellintegralform could be write as an integral:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{\\text{in}}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\iiint_V \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\mathrm{d}V,\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the region enclosed by $S$, $\\rho$ is the **density**[^delta] of charges at some place inside $S$.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Real world charges are not point charge](image.png)\n:::\n\n[^rhs]: Right hand side.\n\n[^delta]: In the case of point charges, this density if *infinite*. Mathematicians use so-called [$\\delta$-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) to describe the behaviour of this kind of \"degenerated\" density. It is not a function, just a symbol following some rules that deals with the Mathematical OCD that forces the form of a certain integral unchanged when some mass is concentrated on a small point.\n\n\nWhat about the LHS of @eq-maxwellintegralform? We *expect* it to be also written in a kind of volume integral to cancel it out with the RHS:\n$$\n\\oiint_S \\mathbf{E} \\cdot  \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{A} = \\iiint_V \\boxed{???} \\mathrm{d}V.\n$$\n\nAnd then\n$$\n\\iiint_V \\boxed{???} \\mathrm{d}V = \\iiint_V \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\mathrm{d}V\n$${#eq-tripleint}\nholds for *any*[^any] volume $V$, so we can claim that\n$$\n\\boxed{???} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}.\n$${#eq-tripleintDiff}\n\n[^any]: *Any* is very important! Without *any*, we cannot derive @eq-tripleint from @eq-tripleintDiff.\n\nLuckily! [**Stoke's Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem) tells us\n$$\n\\boxed{???} = \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{E}.\n$$\nFor those of you not familiar with multivariable calculus, $\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{E}$ is called the **divergence**[^divnotation] of $\\mathbf{E}$, which is a scalar-valued function purely derived from $\\mathbf{E}$.\n\n[^divnotation]: Also denoted $\\mathbf{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$.\n\nFinally! We got the differential form:\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}.\n}\n$${#eq-diff}\n\n## Thinking Problem\n\n::: {#exr-thinking}\nThink about what properties of $\\mathbf{E}$ ensures that @eq-diff holds true?\n:::\n\n::: {#sol-thinking}\nThere are only two properties of electric fields that are used to obtain @eq-diff:\n\n- Inverse square\n- Superposition\n\nStoke's Theorem don't count because it holds for any vector fields. \n\nSuperposition is trivial. The non-trivial part is inverse square. This property ensures that we can extend the sphere to an arbitrary surface in @fig-pointcharge. What is the nature of inverse square? \n\nWell, we live in 3-dimensional space. Everything that spreads should somehow decay at the rate of $1/r^2$, like light, gravity, sound, etc. Otherwise it will against the conservation of energy. In general, if we live in a $N$-dim world, fields should naturally decay at the rate of $1/r^{N-1}$. In other words, everything in $N$-dim world should decay at the rate of \"area\" decay.
