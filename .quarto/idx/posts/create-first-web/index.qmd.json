However, personal websites for blogs, a special type of website, is actually programmatic. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) provides a convenient building templates for that. To make a new blog in Hugo, one could only just create a new folder, write a markdown file (in a specific format) and that's it. You don't need ANY knowledge about HTML or CSS. Well do you need to buy a domain name for everyone to see your posts? Well, GitHub Pages is a free service where you just push some contents in a repository of your own with some extremely easy command line, you created your sites of names like `yourname.github.io`.\n\n## Tools needed\n\n### Homebrew (Packet Manager)\n\nWe will use a packet manager called Homebrew to install Hugo. Follow the commands [here](https://brew.sh) to download Homebrew first, or you can execute:\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nOnce downloaded, if you don't get any error by entering this in the terminal in any folder, you installed it properly (Install testing):\n\n```\nbrew --version\n```\n\n### Git (Version Control System)\n\nYou can use Homebrew to install Git:\n\n```\nbrew install git\ngit --version # install testing\n```\n\n## Install Hugo\n\nRun this in any folder:\n\n```\nbrew install hugo\n```\n\nInstall testing:\n\n```\nhugo version\n```\n\n## Run Example Theme\n\n### Create Framework\n\nEnter the terminal in any folder, you will be creating another main folder called `mysite` in it. Folder `mysite` will contain all the contents that are relevant to your website:\n\n```\nhugo new site mysite\ncd mysite\n```\n\nFolder `mysite` should look like this:\n\n![Inside `mysite` folder](mysite-initial.png)\n\nwith most folders in it empty. This is the framework.\n\n### Choose Theme\n\nThe `themes` folder is empty, now we will add some code representing a theme inside it. Now choose a template [here](https://themes.gohugo.io) and downlaod its source code folder inside the `themes` folder. I use [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack)\n\n```\ncd themes/\ngit clone https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack.git # Replace as needed\n```\n\n### Run Theme\n\nNow there should be a folder inside `themes`. Now copy all the things inside a folder like `exampleSite` into the main `mysite` folder (''replace''). \n\n![Copy the contents in `exampleSite` into `mysite`](copy-4-files.png)\n\nGo to the main `mysite` folder and remove the original `hugo.tomal` file, or you can do:\n\n```\npwd # should be in \"mysite\"\nrm hugo.tomal\n```\n\nThen (in `mysite` folder), run:\n\n```\nhugo server -D\n```\n\nit will prompt something like:\n\n```\nBuilt in 865 ms\nEnvironment: \"development\"\nServing pages from disk\nRunning in Fast Render Mode.
