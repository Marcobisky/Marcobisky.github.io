## Takeaways {.unnumbered}

## Hi!

This is my crash course on complex analysis without analysis and complex stuff. I will try to bring you the most beautiful and fascinating things about complex analysis **in the most intuitive sense**.

I'm sure you are already familiar with the addition, multiplication of complex numbers, maybe you are not yet familiar with computing the following expression or even don't think they make sense:
$$
i^i, \log(-1), \sin(2i)
$$

### How to invent new math

Now I bet you feel a bit uncomfortable and at least not very freely using complex numbers. But you definitely feel comfortable using negative numbers, right? **Why is that?**

Why do you think something that squares to $-1$ is more weird than something that add $1$ to $0$? Let's rewind to the time to only positive numbers existed. Nothing is more *natural* and *inevitable* than positive numbers, because they represent the number of things when we count in an abstract way. Nothing is real life corresponds to the number $1$, but everything *can* be represented by $1$ when taken as a whole. However, what is exactly "$1$" is not so clear. Everyone just use that from our instinct.

Naturally, in our daily experience like counting or trading, we start to do operations on (positive) numbers. At first, we add numbers together. But sometimes, we accidentally add too much, so we need to subtract. Sometimes, there is too much to add, so we begin to multiply things. Inevitably, we also need to divide things.
