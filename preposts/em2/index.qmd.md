## Takeaway

## Introduction

This is the I-2 chapter of my electromagnetics series, this chapter is optional, feel free to jump to the second chapter if you are not interested in how electric field behave in *matter*.

## Polarization

In chapter I, we know how electric field behave in free space, i.e., there is no atoms or molecules in the space. However, we know that in matter, there are tiny charged particles inside which might affect the ambient electric field.
