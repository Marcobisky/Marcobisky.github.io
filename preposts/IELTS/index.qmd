## Reading

<!-- ----------------------------------------- -->
::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Tips
- 要有明显的证据才行! **如果是推断出来的结论不算** (比如 may switch job 不等于 may demand higher salary).
- 注意以下句子, 句子一定要看完整, 有时候看起来是相反的其实后面又转折回来了!
    - It's not ... but ... (but 后面才是重点)

- 填词要填完整 (只要不超过 1/2/3 个词)! (尽量多!!!)
- **Do not seek for the exact words** cause the they must have changed it for the test.
- 选项要看完整!! **每个选项的意思和强调的点都要明白**, 对比相似的选项, 哪个最合适?
    - 或者从出题人的角度, 误导项会怎么出?
- 句子读不懂一般是划分有问题, 比如:
    - a study by David Storey of Warwick University found that in Britain 70% of businesses started by people over 55 survived. (over 55 是形容 people 的).
- 选项一般都按照文章的顺序出现.

## Tips
- 注意单复数!!
- 注意是合起来的一个词还是两个:
    - washbasin (not wash basin)
    - waterproof (not water-proof)

- 答案不一定按顺序出现! 不要听到关键词后再等答案, 有可能答案在前面就出现了! 也尽量不要听关键词, 而是听意思! (因为有可能关键词一直不出现, 已经讲到后面的题目了)
    - 如果感觉后面某个空的答案已经出来了, 先记上!
- 听力的时候 Mental picture **文章大意结构树**, 要分段明确!
- 能写两个词就不要写一个!
- 如果有人名, 一定要听清谁是谁!
