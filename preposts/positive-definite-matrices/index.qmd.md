If you remember these ...

- The autocorrelation function of a stationary process is *positive definite*.

They seems irrelevant at first glance, but if you think the way I do, you will master it as if it is part of your body!

Well, the solution is: **Pick a definition that let you feel a little bit more comfortable!**
