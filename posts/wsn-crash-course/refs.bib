    ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we obtained the optimized network allocation vector (NAV) for underwater handshaking-based protocols, as inefficient determination of the NAV leads to unnecessarily long silent periods. We propose a scheme which determines the NAV by taking into account all possible propagation delays: propagation delay between a source and a destination; propagation delay between a source and the neighbors; and propagation delay between a destination and the neighbors. Such an approach effectively allows the NAV to be determined precisely equal to duration of a busy channel, and the silent period can be set commensurate to that duration. This allows for improvements in the performance of handshaking-based protocols, such as the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol, in terms of throughput and fairness. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, performance comparisons were carried out through simulations with prior NAV setting methods. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other schemes in terms of throughput and fairness.},
