### Topics

- Music
    - Listening to Bach's music is like building a grand architecture masterpiece in my mind. I mean it's so structured and harmonious, every note has its reason.
    - emotional / rational music
    - Bach's music and Mahler's music represent two extremes. 
    - Mahler was a late-romantic composer. His music is meant to be not listened to but experienced. Every symphony is like a journey, with ups and downs, twists and turns, from the beginning to the end, so many unexpected moments.
    - His 1st symphony: tell the story of the birth of a giant, the emergence. You can even hear the giant's footsteps in the first movement.
    - 2nd: Can be viewed as a continuation of the character in his 1st symphony, I mean it's quite abundant in musical ideas, but it's basically about the death and resurrection of the giant.
    - The curse of the ninth. 
    - vivid, intense, powerful, large scale
    - It's like experiencing the big bang.
    - A symphony must be like the world, it must embrace everything. -- Gustav Mahler
    - Musical qualities: emotional expression, length of the work, size of orchestra, loudness and quietness, pushed through the absolute limits.
    - They managed to express some kind of world philosophy, someway of looking at, or experiencing the world.

    - 做选择但是选项中没有你想说的: I'd say I actually prefer studying at night because it's quieter and I can focus better. But if I had to choose between morning and afternoon, I'd go for the afternoon.

- Hometown
    - The weather is very nice here, just a little scorching in summer, if you don't mind the heat. Nanchang is also known for a famous revolutionary event, the Nanchang Uprising. Therefore Nanchang is often referred to as the "Hero City". The city is well-connected by subways. 
    - Here in Nanchang, we have some iconic landmarks such as the Tengwang Pavilion, one of the four great towers of China, and the Star of Nanchang, a giant Ferris wheel, you can take a ride on it to have a bird's-eye view of the beautiful city.
    - Nanchang is also the spiciest city in China. It's very easy to accidentally order something insanely spicy by the way.

    - It was one of my best experiences.
    - I think it was the first time I tried diving. 
    - And I also tried -- I'm not sure what's it called, like a banana boat, where you sit on a banana-shaped inflatable boat and get pulled by a speedboat.
    - Cool seawater splashes up and hits me right in the face. I can never forget that feeling, it's like, my hormone level is high above, just refreshing.

    - **Household necessities**: toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, toilet paper, tissues, detergent, etc.

- Sports

    - During the day, I rarely read novels because of my academic schedule. I usually make use of the time before bed at night to listen to podcasts or audiobooks, which I find very relaxing and enjoyable.

## Sep-2 Update

- 阅读先扫一眼问题, 确定大意, 然后仔细读文章, 每段的大意一定要知道

- 听力先看问题, 看的时候一定要会断句, 确定空白的词性, 并预测. 听的时候一定不要只听关键词, 一定要听懂意思 (意思是第一位的)
    - 听力尤其是选择题很容易错, 填词倒还好. 而且一般情况下所有的选项都会听到, 千万不要只听关键词!
    - 听的时候要在大脑中分段! 比如 OK, 他说完了一件事情, 开始说下一件事情了, 这个时候一定要缓过神来.

- 听力的心态: 不要当作考试, 比如询问租房的场景, 要想象成与他进行对话!

## Sep-8 Update

- 机考阅读选择题一般都会有两个明显的错误答案, 所以其实每道就是两个选项, 所以一定要回排除法!

- 阅读一定要在文章中看完句子, 后面的内容有可能有转折!!!
