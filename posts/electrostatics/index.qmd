## Takeaway {.unnumbered}

1. Changing the mindset from *forces* to *fields*.

2. Maxwell's First Equation = Inverse Square + Superposition

3. Curl-free (conservative) property of static electric field has nothing to do with the inverse square property! (It's because the radial direction of the field.)

## Welcome! {#sec-welcome}

This is the first chapter of my electromagnetics series. I will introduce to you the theory of electromagnetism through this series, not in the order of history, but in the order of a self-contained logic that satisfies people. The reason I did this is that history is too complicated, confusing and sometimes even wrong. One would not fully understand the trajactory of any subject (geometry, Newton's law, General relativity, etc) without *experiencing* it. So I would NOT recommend you go through the tedious history of *any* subject but develop **your own** logic-complete explanation of it after reading tons of wikipedia and stackexchange, in other words, that explanation should make sense in the history in another parallel universe!

You will understand the first one of the famous Maxwell's Equations in this blog:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \quad &\text{(Gauss's law)} \\
    \mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for magnetism)} \\
    \mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \quad &\text{(Faraday's law)} \\
    \mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \quad &\text{(Amp√®re's law)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Physics World to Math World

Physics originates from observations in the real world. If you keep an eye on it, you could discover the following phenomena yourself:

1. The force between two charges is proportional to their charge, and inversely proportional to their distance, squared.

2. No isolated "magnetic charges" found in nature. 

3. Changing magnetic flux leads to current in a circuit!

4. Two parallel wires attract or repel each other when current is applied!

These four observations leads to the four equations by Maxwell.

## Integral Form of Maxwell's First Equation

### Inverse Square Law

According to observation 1, we could write[^letter]:
$$
F \propto \frac{Qq}{r^2},
$$
or in an equation:
$$
\boxed{
F = k \frac{Qq}{r^2},
}
$$

[^letter]: Non-bold-face letters ($F$) are scalars, bold-face letters ($\mathbf{F}$) are vectors.

where $k$ is a constant, $Q$ and $q$ are the amount of ***charge***[^chargedef] on two small objects, $r$ is their distance.

[^chargedef]: The unit of charge (Coulomb) is defined in the following way (The reason *Ampere* are defined first is because *Ampere* happens to be one of the *base unit* of [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#:~:text=The%20SI%20comprises%20a%20coherent,candela%20(cd%2C%20luminous%20intensity))):
- **Current: Ampere** (I: A): First we define Ampere (surprise!) to be the intensity of current on two ideal wires that are 1 metre apart and produces a force of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ N between them (1N is defined to be the force that makes an object of mass 1kg moves at the acceleration of $1\text{m}/\text{s}^2$)
- **Charge: Coulomb** (Q: C): Then we define Coulomb to be the amount of charge the that passes through a point with a current of 1A over 1 second.

### Conservative Property

Let's consider the work done when we fix $Q$ and gradually move $q$ in a certain path. Since the force from $Q$ to $q$ is always radially from $Q$, it turns out that the work done only depends on the *initial* and *final* position of $q$ regardless of the moving process in between! We say a force like this ***Conservative***[^conservative]. We would like to think that there is a number $U$ attached at every spatial point around $Q$ such that the the work done from point $A$ and $B$ is just that $U(A)-U(B)$[^ubua], i.e.,
$$
W_{AB} =: U(A) - U(B).
$$

[^conservative]: 
It's worth noting that *conservativity* has nothing to do with the inverse square property. The potential energy of hypothetical "inverse force" and "inverse cubic force" are:
$$
U_{\frac{1}{r}} = -kQq \ln r,
$$
and
$$
U_{\frac{1}{r^3}} = \frac{kQq}{2} \frac{1}{r^2}.
$$



[^ubua]: Why not $U(B)-U(A)$? Because we want the quantity $U$ also indicates the tendancy that $q$ would move. More likely to move, $U$ should be larger. 

::: {.column-margin}
![$U(A)$ is expected to be larger than $U(B)$](potential_energy.png)
:::

$U(r)$ is called the ***potential energy*** at $r$. We claim[^const] that 
$$
\boxed{
U(r) = -k \frac{Qq}{r},
}
$$
because
$$
W_{AB} 
= \int_{A \to B} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\mathrm{d}r}
= \int_{r_0}^{r_1} k \frac{Qq}{r^2} \mathrm{d}r
= -k \frac{Qq}{r_1} - k \frac{Qq}{r_0}
=: U(A) - U(B).
$$

[^const]: Actually, should be $U(r) = -k \frac{Q}{r} + \operatorname{const}$. But when $r \to \infty$, we expect $U$ to be $0$ because $q$ do not have the ability to do work.

Therefore, the work done is just the difference of $U$ with a negative sign:
$$
W_{AB} = - \Delta U.
$$

We also know that

$$
\mathrm{d} W_{AB} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{l} = F \cdot \mathrm{d} l_\parallel,
$$
where $\mathrm{d} \mathbf{l}$ is a small displacement and $\mathrm{d} l_\parallel$ is the length of the projection of that small displacement onto the direction of $\mathbf{F}$, i.e., the direction of $\mathbf{\nabla} U$, reversed. Hence, 
$$
F = \frac{\mathrm{d} W_{AB}}{\mathrm{d} l_\parallel} = - \frac{\mathrm{d} U}{\mathrm{d} l_\parallel}.
$$

In vector notation,
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{F} = - \mathbf{\nabla} U.
}
$${#eq-FU}


### Get Rid of Test-charge

When $q$ is far smaller than $Q$, it is called a test charge, which is used to "test" the effect of $Q$ to its surroundings and minimize other interference. It is naturally to get rid of $q$ and define a quantity $E$ that only depends on $Q$, we expect that $E$ satisfies:
$$
\mathbf{F} =: \mathbf{E} q,
$$
where $E$ obviously equal to:
$$
\boxed{
E = k \frac{Q}{r^2}.
}
$$

We call $E$ the **electric field** generated by $Q$[^Eproperty].

[^Eproperty]: Since $\mathbf{E}$ is equivalent to force (just up to a constant), all properties of $\mathbf{E}$ is inherited from $\mathbf{F}$, such as *vector property*, *superposition*, *conservativity*, etc.

Therefore, @eq-FU could be written as:
$$
\mathbf{E}q = - \mathbf{\nabla} U.
$${#eq-EqU}

We could also get rid of $q$ in @eq-EqU by defining a quantity $V$ called the ***(Electric) potential*** generated by $Q$:
$$
\boxed{
U := Vq,
}
$$
so we have
$$
\mathbf{E}q = -\mathbf{\nabla} V q
$$
$$
\implies 
\boxed{
\mathbf{E} = - \mathbf{\nabla} V.
}
$${#eq-EV}

You can compare @eq-FU and @eq-EV, the latter is test-charge-free version of the former!

## The spirit of *fields*

[This mindset from *force* to *field* is extremely important!]{style="color: orange"} "Field" originates from "force" but later evolves independently from it, as you will see. Thinking in terms of "fields" rather than "forces" is a key factor that distinguishes beginners from experts. Now you have evolved to the second level -- make "fields" be your **second nature**!

### An Interesting Question

How to know how many charges inside some closed region?

::: {.column-margin}
![The question](the-question.png)
:::

::: {#prp-smallprob}
The charge inside some closed surface $S$ can be calculated by only looking at the field sitting on its *surface*[^prp1]:
$$
\text{Flux} \propto Q_{\text{in}},
$$
where the flux $\Phi$ is defined:
$$
\Phi := \oiint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{A}.
$$
:::

[^prp1]: This claim directly comes from the *inverse square law* and *superposition principle of fields*.

::: {#sol-smallprob}
1. We will consider the case then there is only one point charge $q$ inside $S$.

    Consider a sphere $R$ of radius $r$ around $q$ in @fig-pointcharge, it's obviously that the flux through $R$ does not related to $r$, because the surface area increases at the rate of $r^2$ and the field decays at the rate of $1/r^2$. Just to be intimidating, 
    $$
    \Phi_R = \oiint_R k \frac{q}{r^2} dA = k \frac{q}{r^2} \cdot 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi k q \propto q.
    $$

    We commonly let 
    $$
    \boxed{
        k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
    }
    $${#eq-flux}
    to simpify[^kreason] @eq-flux to be
    $$
    \Phi_R = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
    $$

[^kreason]: We introduce the symbol $\epsilon_0$ by the motivation to eliminate the "$4 \pi$" @eq-flux. But the meaning of $\epsilon_0$ would be clear later until we introduce the electric fields in matter. Don't worry.

2. Now we claim that 
    $$
    \Phi_R = \Phi_S,
    $$
    where $S$ is an arbitrary closed surface outside $R$.
    
    Again we use the *inverse square property*, the flux through $\mathrm{d}R$ should be same as the flux through the blue circle in @fig-pointcharge. Plus, the flux through the blue circle is exactly the same as the flux through $\mathrm{d}S$ as shown in @fig-fluxcomp (since their "perpendicular" surface area are the same)

3. We then use *superposition property* of fields to obtain the equation of multiple charges enclosed.

    Suppose there are $N=3$ point charges inside $S$ as shown in @fig-super, the total flux is

    $$
    \Phi 
    = \oiint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} 
    = \sum_{i = 1}^3 \left(\oiint_S \mathbf{E}_i \cdot  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A}\right)
    = \sum_{i = 1}^3 \frac{q_i}{\epsilon_0}
    = \frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{\epsilon_0}.
    $${#eq-n3}

    Of course @eq-n3 can be generalized when $N$ is arbitrary. And ura! We have just proof the integral version of Maxwell's first equation!
    $$
    \boxed{
    \oiint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{\epsilon_0}.
    }
    $${#eq-maxwellintegralform}

    This is also known as **Gauss's Law**. @eq-maxwellintegralform holds for *any* closed surface $S$.

## Differential Form of Maxwell's First Equation

The charges in the real world are not commonly appears like an infinitesimal point. They distributed evenly through a body instead of concentrate on a point of no size. Therefore, $Q_{\text{in}}$ on the RHS[^rhs] of @eq-maxwellintegralform could be write as an integral:
$$
\frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{\epsilon_0} = \iiint_V \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \mathrm{d}V,
$$
where $V$ is the region enclosed by $S$, $\rho$ is the **density**[^delta] of charges at some place inside $S$.

::: {.column-margin}
![Real world charges are not point charge](image.png)
:::

[^rhs]: Right hand side.

[^delta]: In the case of point charges, this density if *infinite*. Mathematicians use so-called [$\delta$-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) to describe the behaviour of this kind of "degenerated" density. It is not a function, just a symbol following some rules that deals with the Mathematical OCD that forces the form of a certain integral unchanged when some mass is concentrated on a small point.


What about the LHS of @eq-maxwellintegralform? We *expect* it to be also written in a kind of volume integral to cancel it out with the RHS:
$$
\oiint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} = \iiint_V \boxed{???} \mathrm{d}V.
$$

And then
$$
\iiint_V \boxed{???} \mathrm{d}V = \iiint_V \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \mathrm{d}V
$${#eq-tripleint}
holds for *any*[^any] volume $V$, so we can claim that
$$
\boxed{???} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
$${#eq-tripleintDiff}

[^any]: *Any* is very important! Without *any*, we cannot derive @eq-tripleint from @eq-tripleintDiff.

Luckily! [**Stoke's Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem) tells us
$$
\boxed{???} = \operatorname{div} \mathbf{E}.
$$
For those of you not familiar with multivariable calculus, $\operatorname{div} \mathbf{E}$ is called the **divergence**[^divnotation] of $\mathbf{E}$, which is a scalar-valued function purely derived from $\mathbf{E}$.

[^divnotation]: Also denoted $\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}$.

Finally! We got the differential form:
$$
\boxed{
\operatorname{div} \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
}
$${#eq-diff}

## Thinking Problem

::: {#exr-thinking}
Think about what properties of $\mathbf{E}$ ensures that @eq-diff holds true?
:::

::: {#sol-thinking}
There are only two properties of electric fields that are used to obtain @eq-diff:

- Inverse square
- Superposition

Stoke's Theorem don't count because it holds for any vector fields. 

Superposition is trivial. The non-trivial part is inverse square. This property ensures that we can extend the sphere to an arbitrary surface in @fig-pointcharge. What is the nature of inverse square? 

Well, we live in 3-dimensional space. Everything that spreads should somehow decay at the rate of $1/r^2$, like light, gravity, sound, etc. Otherwise it will against the conservation of energy. In general, if we live in a $N$-dim world, fields should naturally decay at the rate of $1/r^{N-1}$. In other words, everything in $N$-dim world should decay at the rate of "area" decay. [This paper](../../cv/physics-paper.pdf) by myself delved a little deeper inside this inspiration.
