<!-- ## First Year

- Demystifying Mathematics: My curiosity with math and science started at a young age. But it was until I encounter the theory of sets in my first year of UESTC that I truly contact serious mathematics. I was amazed by that sets unifies not almost, but *all* concepts in mathematics. Functions are sets, Matrices are sets, even numbers are sets! 

- The Art of Digital Circuits: I am so lucky to be recommended a book by a friend, *Introduction to Computing Systems* by Yale Patt. This is one of my favorite books ever. It teaches me how to build a computer from the bottom - logic gates, to the top - a single-cycle CPU. The author builds a simple yet beautiful ISA - LC-3. This helps me a lot in understanding RISCV later.

- Embedded Processors: At the same time, I also learned how to use C to tell a microcontroller what to do. The `C` program we wrote is first convert to binary by compilers and assemblers. Then these bits are downloaded into a place called memory. The circuit in the computer pick them out one line at a time. This bits are broken down, different parts controls different components, basically acting as select signals to literally modify the circuit connection. I played with C51 and STM32 using assembly and C/C++, I made lots of fun projects such as music players, dormitory door openers, and even later integrate a CNN into it to detect falling events of patients.
